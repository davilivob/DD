Ok, so the reason that I think I have to make this video is because, I'm not really good at programming.
I mean, I'm a rookie, still learning about these computer things. 
And I know there are some engineers, program designers. 
They can build a let's say, a product such that you can just open the file and use 'em done, easy, right?
