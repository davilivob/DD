His father's thick leathery boot connected hard with Murdoc's backside, hurtling the young child onto the stage. 'Start singing, you little sod, or I'll smash your teeth.

The bright, blinding lights shone straight into his eyes, as the smell of warm beer, stale cigarettes and cheap aftershave wafted across the pub. The music started up and as Murdoc looked to the side his eyes implored to be spared this dignity-stripping ritual. His father growled his decision nice and clearly.

The local 'Are-You-A-Star?' talent contest was the bane of Murdoc's life. Each month the local pub would hold this type of demeaning event. Talentless clods would enter, impersonating the big names of the day, gurning their way through soul-sapping performance after mindless performance. The prize and the chance to humiliate yourself further in the bi-annual county finals. If you were really good you could then go on to make a cock of yourself on national TV.
