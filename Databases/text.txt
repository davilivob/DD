His father's thick leathery boot connected hard with Murdoc's backside, hurtling the young child onto the stage. 'Start singing, you little sod, or I'll smash your teeth.

The bright, blinding lights shone straight into his eyes, as the smell of warm beer, stale cigarettes and cheap aftershave wafted across the pub. The music started up and as Murdoc looked to the side his eyes implored to be spared this dignity-stripping ritual. His father growled his decision nice and clearly.

The local 'Are-You-A-Star?' talent contest was the bane of Murdoc's life. Each month the local pub would hold this type of demeaning event. Talentless clods would enter, impersonating the big names of the day, gurning their way through soul-sapping performance after mindless performance. The prize and the chance to humiliate yourself further in the bi-annual county finals. If you were really good you could then go on to make a cock of yourself on national TV.

Murdoc's dad had often threatened to enter his son into this cattle show, purely as another vague opportunity to make some fast dough, and had this month backed his claim.

Murdoc: Everything about this made me sick. How these stinky old giffers were sitting in a knackered-out pub, accepting this crap as entertainment. Watching talentless people pointlessly impersonating other talentless celebrity stars... Watching my bullying basterd father trying to work this game for cash. None of it worked. If you don't watch it, that's your future right there.

Murdoc swore from this moment on never again would he take to the stage under someone else's direction. He would wreak his revenge on this world of buffoons.

Murdoc: Yeah. You could say that was the day that Gorillaz were really born... from that seed of rejection. A rejection of all of that kind of rubbish.

Murdoc pauses for a moment reflecting on the long-forgotten memory. He then looks up.

'Actually, I'm gobsmacked you've chosen to open your stupid book with the story.
