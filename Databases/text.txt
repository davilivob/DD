In two thousand one Gorillaz burst out of every TV and radio with their seminal hit Clint Eastwood and then unleashed a fantastic collision of dub, reggae, hip hop, punk and Cuban music, in the form of their debut album. They thrilled us and wowed us with their jaw-drapping visuals and wicked sense of adventure. They brought a fresh, original and vital voice, breathing new life into tired formats, and left a rich, colourful legacy in their wake to inspire a whole new generation of artists to come.
